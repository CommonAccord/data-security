Assess.sec=The GA4GH <b>Data Security Infrastructure Policy</b> is based on a balanced approach to risk management that relies on each individual stakeholder to help protect the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of the GA4GH ecosystem. Each stakeholder should assess its individual risk on an on-going basis and ensure that its own implemented policies, procedures, and technology protections are appropriate and sufficient for managing the identified risks not only to the enterprise, but to the GA4GH ecosystem.
