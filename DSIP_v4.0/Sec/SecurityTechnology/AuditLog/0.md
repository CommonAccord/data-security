Ti=Audit Logs 

1.sec=Each data processor must record and maintain a log of security-relevant events involving access to or use of application and data services under that provider’s control. 

2.sec=For each security-relevant event, the data processor should record the following data elements: user identity, type of event, date and time, success or failure indication, origination of event, name of affected data, system component, or resource {FtNt.24.Xnum}. 

3.sec=Each data processor should retain the audit log history for at least one year, with a minimum of three months immediately available for analysis (for example, online, archived, or restorable from backup). This best practice must be interpreted within the constraints of applicable law. 

4.sec=Each data processor must monitor activity on systems and networks under its control to detect potential security breaches and data misuse. 

5.0.sec=Each data processor should have a layered approach to instrumentation including, but not exclusive to; 

5.1.sec= Log analysis 

5.2.sec= Exception handling analysis 

5.3.sec= Web Application Firewalls/Intrusion Detection Systems 

5.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

6.sec=Data processors’ audit log records should be integratable with existing enterprise security monitoring tools. 

7.sec=Data controllers and their processors must jointly implement the capability to generate an accounting of accesses to and disclosures of data that may be associated with the individual’s identity.
