Ti=Data Integrity 

1.sec=Each data processor must protect the integrity of genomic and health-related data that it holds, uses, or transmits. 

2.sec=Each data processor that transmits or receives transmissions containing genomic or health-related data should use a collision-resistant hash function that complies with the Secure Hash Standard {FtNt.25.Xnum} by NIST (e.g., IETF SHA-2 {FtNt.26.Xnum}) to verify the integrity of the transmission. 

3.sec=Each data controller must ensure the accuracy and verifiability of data and associated metadata. 

4.sec=Each data controller must ensure that data provenance information is associated with data made available to consumers.
