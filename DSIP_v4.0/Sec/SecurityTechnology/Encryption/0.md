Ti=Cryptographic Controls 

1.sec=Each data processor must ensure that any cryptographic controls used are compliant with all applicable standards, agreements, laws, and regulations. 

2.sec=Each data processor that stores genomic or health-related data must use strong encryption (cryptography based on industry-tested and accepted algorithms, along with strong key lengths and proper key-management practices) to encrypt the data for storage {FtNt.27.Xnum}. 

3.sec=Each data processor must ensure that plaintext data encryption keys are stored outside the system in which data encrypted with those keys are persisted. When a key hierarchy is used, plaintext key encryption keys should be stored separately on the system storing data encryption keys. 

4.sec=Data processors should use privacy-preserving encryption methods (e.g., homomorphic encryption {FtNt.28.Xnum}, secure multi-party computation {FtNt.29.Xnum}) when applicable and practical.
