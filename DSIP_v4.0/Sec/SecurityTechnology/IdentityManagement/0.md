Ti=Identity Management 

0.sec=The effectiveness of the <b>Data Security Infrastructure Policy</b> ultimately is dependent upon the degree to which the actors (individuals and software services) are known and can be trusted to conform to applicable policy. 

1.sec=Each API exposed by data and application services within the GA4GH community must have the capability to electronically authenticate its fully qualified domain name using a server certificate or, within the EU, a qualified electronic signature, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC{FtNt.7.Xnum}. 

2.sec=Each data processor must authenticate the identity of individuals and software accessing data and services under that processorâ€™s control. 

3.sec=Data processors should externalize authentication and authorization services to trusted identity providers and brokers. 

4.sec=The level of assurance to which individual identities will be established (i.e., identity proofing) and authenticated must be consistent with the level of risk associated with the actions to be performed by that individual. Each data processor is encouraged to use the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63-3 {FtNt.8.Xnum} as guidance in determining the appropriate level of assurance required for identity proofing, authentication, and federation. 

5.sec=Data processors should use the <b>GA4GH Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure</b> (AAI) standard {FtNt.9.Xnum} to federate identity authentication and service authorization. Data processors should also use GA4GH standards for representing researcher identity attributes in OpenID Connect (OIDC) claims {FtNt.10.Xnum}, and data use ontology (DUO) {FtNt.11.Xnum} for representing security and privacy attributes of shared data.
