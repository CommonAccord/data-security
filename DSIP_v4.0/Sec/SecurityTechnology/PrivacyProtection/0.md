Ti=Privacy Protection 

1.sec=Each data controller and data processor should use consent-management, access control, usage monitoring, auditing mechanisms, and other privacy-protecting mechanisms to help ensure that private and sensitive data are collected, used, shared, and reused only in accordance with the permissions granted by the individual (or authorized representative) to whom the data pertains, and in accordance with applicable law and institutional policies. Private and sensitive data include both personal data, such as genomic and health-related data, and data considered private and confidential by the data holder or jurisdictional law, such as, for example, data governed under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) {FtNt.14.Xnum}, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) {FtNt.15.Xnum}, under appendix J of the Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations {FtNt.16.Xnum}, under the Australian Information Commissioner Act (AICA) {FtNt.17.Xnum}, or any other similar law. 

2.sec=Each data controller should ensure that any procedures used to eliminate or minimize direct and/or indirect identifiers from data (e.g., pseudonymisation, de-identification, anonymisation) are performed at the earliest practical point in the workflow to minimize potential exposure of individual identity. 

3.sec=Each data controller should maintain a data inventory that includes defined sensitivity of data, restrictions on storage and data flows, and contracted data services responsible for enforcing these restrictions. 

4.sec=Each data controller should monitor data usage to detect attempts to access or use data other than as authorized, including attempts to analytically derive identity. 

5.sec=Each data controller and data processor should implement mechanisms to prevent the identity of individuals from being leaked through covert means such as metadata, URLs, message headers, and inference attacks. 

6.sec=Each data controller and data processor should implement safeguards to reduce the likelihood that de-identified, pseudonymized, or anonymised data can be re-identified through the query results or data record linkage (to prevent attacks such as Bustamante {FtNt.18.Xnum} and Homer {FtNt.19.Xnum}). To this end, they should use privacy-preserving record linkage methods {FtNt.20.Xnum} and/or any other methods to reduce the risk of re-identification under formal frameworks such as differential privacy {FtNt.21.Xnum}. 

7.sec=Each data controller must obtain the individual authorisations (e.g., consents) required by applicable law and institutional policy, and for conveying these authorisations, or a link to these authorisations, along with the associated data. 

8.sec=Each data controller must update provenance and confidentiality metadata associated with the data under its control, preferably using HL7 FHIR provenance {FtNt.22.Xnum} and confidentiality {FtNt.23.Xnum} codes.
